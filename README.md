# Midpoints between k-nearest-neighbor data points of a training dataset (midknn) as a validation dataset in regression
This is python and MATLAB codes to calculate the midpoints between k-nearest-neighbor data points of a training dataset (midknn) as a validation dataset in regressionfor. Demonstration of SVR hyperparameter optimization using midknn is also included.
